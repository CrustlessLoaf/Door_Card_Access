# Door_Card_Access
<p>
This projet was completed for a course in which the only requirement was to create a unique solution using a certain amount of actuators and sensors. 

We chose to create a card access door which was controlled via a DC door lock actuator, servo motors, IR remote, and opened upon showing a valid ID to which it was tested using our student ID's.
